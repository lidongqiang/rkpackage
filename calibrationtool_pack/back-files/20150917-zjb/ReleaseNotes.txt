[2.0.0]
DLL:
1. Remove word 'retry' in DUT connection failure message
2. Compare selected bands with trget supported bands, if there is no common band, tool reports error
3. Replace "at@nvm:store_nvm(...)" with "at@nvm:store_nvm_sync(...)" to wait for NVM storage operation complete
4. Add simple CV after 3G Tx calibration
5. Increase exp power for 3db at PCL0 while DCS Tx fast calibration
6. Add parameter "nDelayBeforeConnect" to specify delay time befroe USB connection, for RK tool it should be 0
7. Remove reading application list from 8960, which will save test time for more than 1 second
8. Remove 2 useless commands:"ucal_fac_setup(255,0,{0})" and "ucal_fac_start()" after USB connected
9. No retry in case of RF measurement errors like timeout...

UI:
1. Change tool configuration window UI
2. Add statistics menu to utilize RFTestStatisticsTool
3. Add log window on main window
4. Add channel/PCL entry in config window for cable loss measurement and antenna test
5. Add cable loss limit entry for cable loss measurement
6. Add Tx power limit entry for antenna test
7. In loop test, only the 1st run will reset instrument by setting parameter "bResetInstrument" to true in the 1st run and fasle in following runs, this will save test time for about 1 second
